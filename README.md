The minimum version of Node.js required to run this project is v21.1.0

This project is a React news app that allows users to view articles, sort by different categories and order them into ascending or descending. Users can also vote on articles, comment on them and delete their own comments; a user is already logged in for ease of showcasing the project. This project builds upon a back-end API project that is linked above.

To run the file locally, carry out the following steps:

- Clone the Repo and push the code to a new repository with the following commands:

 - git remote set-url origin YOUR_NEW_REPO_URL_HERE
 - git branch -M main
 - git push -u origin main

Once cloned run 'npm install' in your terminal, following this the setup will be complete.

To view changes made to the code in your browser before deployment, run 'npm run dev' and select open in browser when the pop up appears.
